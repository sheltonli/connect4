While you are playing over the network, please open the console and wait until it says "It's my turn!" cause otherwise it will mess up.

When a player wins their status is updated in the database. When a player ties it is updated in the database.
This is not currently reflected in the ui in anyway.

The amazingly awesome board we made using THREE.js
To make this work each column is clickable.  The pieces are only added when it makes sense (ie. when there is space for them in the column).
The white balls change colour once you click a column to give the illusion of a piece being dropped.
If there are four pieces in a row, guess what .. ? you win!! and the board spins around and the pieces flash different colours!! yeah!


Our implementation makes use of CodeIgniter, AJAX, JSON, JQuery, CSS and MySql.  We used THREE.js to make the board.
I had some previous experience with THREE.js and thought it would be cool.  In the past I referenced threejs.org for this but for this project i referenced my own site

The Captcha was implemented for users when registering.
Our site has been checked on CDF.  Thanks for your time in marking it!
